# Subspace Identification

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to identify refinery plant / chemical plant dynamics using a multiple input
multiple output model. N4SID is used for this *(Numerical Algorithms for Subspace State Space System Identification)*.

 - Import vectors (fake data)
 - Run the case
 - Models are identified

*Need to add predictions based on identified models.*
